An application to assist with the assessment of potential homes or rentals

# Brainstorming

7/18/2020 - Call with Szymon Wojnar to discuss idea - an app that would help with the tracking of potential homes.  Discussion of initial design/wireframe; logical steps and application requirements; creation of user stories.  Details below: 

## UX/UI Design

Dashboard with cards.  Each card will show Property Address, Price, Bed/Bath.  Selecting a card will show more details on page: Address, Square Footage, Bed/Bath, List Price, HOAs, Neighborhood, Type of unit (Single Fam, Condo, TIC, etc.), Parking?, Additional Storage?, Outdoor Space?, separate notes area

Each card can have a background selected after viewing the propety to show a level of interest

## Build Out Steps

1) Create Repo
2) Node/Express server
3) REACT
4) SQL/Sequelize database (relational)

## App Architecture

Disucssion of Front End/ Client App
How to store sensitive information / Password Database / Private API Key?

## Deployment

Discussion around options => Netlify, Heroku, or build our own
Two stage approach; Get it working on Heroku, with a future build of own DevOps related project to build skill base

## Styling Options

Use a UI React Library:
1) Material UI
2) Ant-design
3) Semantic UI
4) Palantir (BluePrint JS)

## Authentication 

Going to use Auth0

## User Stories

- Walk Szymon through rationale behind the UX/UI ideas - the google doc I had been using to track this information
